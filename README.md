# README Generator
Hi!

My name is Zac Gilfoyle.

## Description
This repository contains Javascript used to create a README generator.

This is a culmination of the skills developed whilst learning Node.js.

It utilizes the inquirer package to create a command-line-interface for generating a professional README with markdown.

Below is a demo of the CLI to generate the README.
